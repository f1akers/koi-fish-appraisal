**Design Features:**

The New Generation Currency (NGC) Coin Series was introduced in 2017 by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The new series features native Philippine flora on the reverse side and portraits of national heroes on the obverse side for peso-denominated coins.

The ₱5 coin was redesigned in 2019 with a nonagonal (9-sided) shape to help distinguish it from the ₱1 coin, as the original round design was too similar in size and color.
